# plainboy 
A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme designed for my personal website, https://fullmugs.xyz. 
> Plainboy is a fork of [Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-be), which is a port of the original [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/).

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER
This is in no-way meant to be used as a polished Hugo theme. It was designed solely around the requirements of my personal website, and is probably broken in a few ways I may have yet to discover.  You are free to use it as per the MIT License, but I won't guarantee a hiccup-free experience. :)
